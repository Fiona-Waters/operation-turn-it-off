# Operation Turn It Off!

Description:

The problem: We want to heat our home office without heating the whole house.
More info: My husband works from home, he's sitting in the home office all day so he gets cold. Naturally he wants to
turn on the heating but there is no point in heating the whole house when only one room is being used. We bought an electric
heater to solve this issue so when he gets cold he turns it on. The problem is that the room gets too warm and very stuffy. Energy is being wasted and our outlay for electricity is higher than it needs to be.

The solution: Monitor the temperature in the room and allow a suitable reaction i.e. turning the heater on/off using a smart switch and/or notifying us to turn the heater on/off depending on certain criteria for example when a certain temp is reached.

I plan to solve this problem using the following:

- Raspberry Pi and Sense Hat using sensors to track and report temperature and possibly humidity and pressure.
- Wifi to access raspberry pi and smart socket.
- MQTT to publish rasp pi sensor data and allow subscription of such info.
- Thingspeak OR Blynk to allow logging and reading of data as well as notifications by email or to a mobile phone.
- Sonoff S20 wifi Smart socket to allow turning on and off of heater remotely.
- FTDI adapter to allow programming of smart socket.
- Visual Studio Code
- Python
- Possibility of integrating use of Raspberry Pi Camera module.
- Possibility of using Glitch and other programming language/s to create a website where temp data etc can be viewed.
